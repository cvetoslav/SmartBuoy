							<p>Water purity is an important segment of our project. In Europe, water purity at the beaches is checked annually in specialized laboratories and that is the factor that makes the water safe for a bath or not.<br><br>From our research we found out that accorging to the European Environment Agency in a period of a year the water in some beaches can go from excellent qualliy to not eligible for bathing and vice versa. That`s the reason why we want to do simpler water purity check in shorter periods of time.</p>

							<p>There are many ways to check the water purity. The first one is with the use of water purity sensors. This will be the basic method that "Smart Buoy" is going to use live. The other options require AI image recognition. Again, there is one simple and one expensive way. "Smart Buoy" is a packet of functionalities.<br><br>The simle method is to use physical indicators to check for unwanted chemicals, after that with image recognition and the model R-CNN we will check for a change on the indicator. This method will be included in every unit. The other one will use microscopic images to check with same R-CNN image segmentation model for bacterias. This will make the unit more expensive therefore this will be exclusive option.</p>
