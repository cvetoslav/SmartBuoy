							<p>"Smart Buoy" is fully solar-powered. It is really important for us to make no impact to the nature. The needed energy will be provided from one 30W solar panel. It will generate more than enough electricity. If there is excess energy it will stored or distibuted to the local electricity system. <br><br>Another way to make electricity is by the movement of the buoy from the waves. Using the Faraday's law and some physics we can generate low levels of electricity, but more than enough to power "Smart Buoy".</p>
