							<p>The current system consists of flags placed at a close distance of around 50 meters. The flag's colors are different around the world. For example, in Bulgaria, there are three colors: green, yellow, and red. Green - you can swim (no danger), yellow - you are not allowed to go too far in the sea or use inflatables, red - swimming is forbidden.<br><br>Although the colors and their exact meaning are different there is one similarity everywhere - the change of the flag is eighter the lifeguard`s responsibility or someone specialized. He needs to receive the data and the process is very slow. We can use led screens to show the color and update it automatically.<br><br>Also, we are streaming the data in our web app so everyone can see where it is safe for a swim. That can be really helpful for the tourists in the sea/ocean resorts. Many beaches are 'wild', so they don`t have that kind of system, and those who have it work until 6 pm after that everyone is in danger. "Smart buoy" is there for your safety 24/7.</p>
