## Inspiration
The global water pollution problem and the increasing annual drowning cases should not be ignored. We are solving that problem while helping tourism. Drowning is the 3rd leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide, accounting for 7% of all injury-related deaths according to WHO (World Health Organisation). The annual number of drowning cases is 236 000 worldwide. Many of those cases can be prevented with a modern signal system, whether it is safe to go in the open waters.
## What it does
The current system consists of flags placed at a close distance of around 50 meters. The flag's colors are different around the world. For example, in Bulgaria, there are three colors: green, yellow, and red. Green - you can swim (no danger), yellow - you are not allowed to go too far in the sea or use inflatables, red - swimming is forbidden.

Although the colors and their exact meaning are different there is one similarity everywhere - the change of the flag is eighter the lifeguard`s responsibility or someone specialized. He needs to receive the data and the process is very slow. We can use led screens to show the color and update it automatically.

Also, we are streaming the data in our web app so everyone can see where it is safe for a swim. That can be really helpful for the tourists in the sea/ocean resorts. Many beaches are 'wild', so they don`t have that kind of system, and those who have it work until 6 pm after that everyone is in danger. "Smart buoy" is there for your safety 24/7.

Water purity is an important segment of our project. In Europe, water purity at the beaches is checked annually in specialized laboratories and that is the factor that makes the water safe for a bath or not. "Smart Buoy" will check the water purity in shorter periods of time.

## How we built it
**Software**

We made a responsive web application with an informational front page and data visualization. The key parts are the beach flag system live visualization created with MapBox API and the Live Data visualization where you can see current information and water purity for every beach with "Smart Buoy" units.

We also created 3D models and visualizations of a prototype of the "Smart Buoy" unit. We use Fusion360, Blender, Unreal Engine, and more.

**Hardware**

We are going to use one 30W solar panel to collect solar energy and transfer the excess energy to the local electricity system. We will also use wave movement energy, which can be created according to Faraday's law.

For the sensors, we are going to use the BME680 air quality, pressure, and temperature sensor, water purity sensor, and gyroscope for the wave height.

The 3D model will be 3D printed and covered with fiberglass for water resistance. All of the sensors are going to be placed in the buoy, and the buoy will be moving on its Y axis on a long stick that has a solar panel on the top which helps prevent the buoy to get out of the stick.

## Challenges we ran into

It was hard to imagine and sketch the model in the short time we had but with good coordination, we managed to create results. There wasn`t enough information and the research was hard to be precise.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We created a lot of software with finished touches in just 60 hours. This required great coordination which we managed to achieve.

## What we learned

We improved our skills in every segment of the project.

## What's next for Smart Buoy

We are going to create the hardware and connect it with the already working software. Then it is time for distribution.
